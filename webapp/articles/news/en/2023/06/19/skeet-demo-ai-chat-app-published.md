ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands) announced on the 19th the launch of a demo AI chat app built with "Taxify," an open-source library for building zero-maintenance serverless apps on Firebase.

By using this demo, planners and developers can easily imagine what kind of applications can be created using "Taxify" in advance.

Taxify is a full-stack serverless framework that lets you build auto-scaling apps on top of Firebase.

Until now, releasing applications and publishing services required the preparation of application code and servers, and the construction and management of servers, in particular, was costly.

The serverless environment provided by Google Cloud and Firebase eliminates the need for this server construction and management. All server infrastructure automatically scales with user usage, eliminating the need for detailed access forecasting and load management resource management.

Taxify can build and manage these serverless products with one command for developing iOS, Android, and web apps. So Taxify developers can immediately start working on the application logic. And the deployment of the written app is guaranteed.

With Taxify, you can quickly build and release applications leveraging the ChatGPT API.

We have released the app as a demo after completing the Taxify tutorial.

Like this demo, Taxify has everything you need to develop and publish an application, such as authentication and database usage that applications generally do.

TypeScript is used for both the back-end and front-end, but Python can also be used as a backend for each function if necessary, so it can be used when machine learning is required.

We believe that many useful apps will be created using Taxify, and we will continue to develop and improve the Taxify framework.

## Experience new app development
