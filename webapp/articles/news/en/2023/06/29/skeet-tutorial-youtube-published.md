ELSOUL LABO B.V. (head office: Amsterdam, Netherlands) has released a tutorial video on YouTube on building an AI chat app using the ChatGPT API with the full-stack serverless framework Taxify.

## Let's create your original AI Chat App

ChatGPT, which is currently a hot topic, allows you to create your own original AI chat application by using the API.

It can also be customized for you and your organization, so there are many ways to use it.

Also, it is expected that application development using AI will become popular in the future, so please take this opportunity to catch up.

As you progress through the Taxify tutorial, you can create your AI chat app, deploy it on the cloud, and publish the service.

Taxify is a full-stack serverless framework that lets you build auto-scaling apps on top of Firebase.

Until now, releasing applications and publishing services required the preparation of application code and servers, and the construction and management of servers, in particular, was costly.

The serverless environment provided by Google Cloud and Firebase eliminates the need for this server construction and management. All server infrastructure automatically scales with user usage, eliminating the need for detailed access forecasting and load management resource management.

Taxify can build and manage these serverless products with one command for developing iOS, Android, and web apps. So Taxify developers can immediately start working on the application logic. And the deployment of the written app is guaranteed.

With Taxify, you can quickly build and release applications leveraging OpenAI's ChatGPT API.

We have released the app as a demo after completing the Taxify tutorial.

Like this demo, Taxify has everything you need to develop and publish an application, such as authentication and database usage that applications generally do.

TypeScript is used for both the back-end and front-end, but Python can also be used as a backend for each function if necessary, so it can be used when machine learning is required.

We believe that many useful apps will be created using Taxify, and we will continue to develop and improve the Taxify framework.

## Experience new app development

You can immediately develop and publish web, iOS, and Android apps.

With the Taxify tutorial, you can actually build an AI chat app like this demo and have it ready to ship.

We would appreciate it if you could try it.
