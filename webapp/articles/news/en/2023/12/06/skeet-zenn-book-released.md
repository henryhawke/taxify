ELSOUL LABO B.V. (based in Amsterdam, Netherlands, CEO: Fumitake Kawasaki) has showcased new possibilities in community app development integrating Discord and Stripe's APIs using its open-source TypeScript-based serverless framework, "Taxify".

This integration enables developers to seamlessly build chatbots in a serverless environment and integrate payment processing systems. Notably, this approach leverages the core strengths of the Taxify framework, enhancing development efficiency while reducing costs.

This new development model, combining the flexibility of open-source software with the efficiency of cloud-based services, is expected to bring new possibilities to the developer community.

## Overview of the book

Taxify is an open-source serverless framework in TypeScript. This framework allows rapid development of everything from API servers to web, iOS, and Android apps.

Taxify Documentation: https://taxify.dev/en/

TypeScript enhances code quality and maintainability through static typing, detecting errors early. Taxify further adopts cutting-edge technologies like GraphQL and Firestore, offering developers the best development experience. It also facilitates easy development of AI applications utilizing ChatGPT and Vertex AI, and Web3 dApps using blockchain technologies like Solana, being a modular and expandable contemporary application framework.

You can experience a demo of an AI chat app built with Taxify using the following link. It supports PaLM2, Vertex AI, and OpenAI's ChatGPT (GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo), allowing you to compare and examine the features of these technologies.
