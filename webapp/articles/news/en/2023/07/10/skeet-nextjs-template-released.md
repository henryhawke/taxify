Taxify is a TypeScript full-stack serverless framework that lets you build auto-scaling apps on top of Firebase.

Taxify allows you to get your app up and running quickly and maintain it for the long term at a low cost.

This time, he added his highly requested Next.js (https://nextjs.org/) starter from Vercel to his Taxify framework.

This gives you an even faster web app development environment.

This Next.js starter uses SSG (Static Site Generation) technology to achieve strong SEO support, high performance, and reduced hosting costs.

In addition, the settings essential for web development, such as multilingual support and his PWA (available by downloading the app), have already been completed, so you can start developing your application immediately without spending time preparing the development environment. Focus on your code.

At the same time, we released a new AI chat app demo using this Next.js starter and ChatGPT API.

This demo app demonstrates what an app is built when you run the taxify create command.

OpenAI announced on July 7 that its natural language model "GPT-4" API is now available to all ChatGPT Plus users. This demo app also allows you to use the "GPT-4".

By setting the character of the AI assistant, it is also possible to improve the quality of the response.

ChatGPT has become a reliable ally for developers.

This demo also supports syntax highlighting of the program code (because it is colored according to the rules, making it easier to read), and by customizing the number of tokens, etc., you can get a more accurate answer.
