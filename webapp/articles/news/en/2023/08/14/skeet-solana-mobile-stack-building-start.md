ELSOUL LABO B.V. (Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands) announced the version 1.2.0 of the open-source TypeScript full-stack serverless app framework "Taxify."

Taxify is an open-source, TypeScript-based serverless framework that enables the building of full-stack apps on both GCP (Google Cloud) and Firebase.

From the API server to web, iOS, and Android apps, you can consistently develop in TypeScript at lightning speed.

With this update, Taxify also supports the development of the Solana Mobile Stack.

Solana Mobile Stack is a mobile development environment for the Solana blockchain. You can release your mobile app to the Solana dApps Store, optimized for Web3. It charges no fees for app purchases, sales, or subscriptions.

By transitioning the Web3 experience to be mobile-native, it becomes more convenient for users to engage with the blockchain on a daily basis. Furthermore, with the advent of new blockchain applications that harness cameras, GPS, and a range of sensors, we anticipate numerous innovations in the Web3 mobile space.

With Taxify, you can start your Solana Mobile Stack immediately and accelerate the development and release of your Web3 and blockchain apps.

Taxify chose Expo (React Native) as their Solana Mobile Stack development environment. With TypeScript and TailwindCSS, you can develop mobile apps like web development. For those with experience in React development, it becomes easier to rapidly create Web3/Blockchain apps using the Solana Mobile Stack.

Also, in Web3 development, in addition to mobile apps, we usually release dApps that can be used in browsers on the web, but Taxify's Solana Mobile Stack template also comes with a web app using Next.js. and web apps can be developed in almost the same environment consistently in TypeScript.

Taxify has been conceived as an open-source solution, aiming to reduce both development and maintenance costs, thereby enhancing the developer experience in various application development scenarios worldwide.

See the official documentation for the details.
