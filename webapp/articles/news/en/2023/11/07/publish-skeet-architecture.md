■ Product Overview

Taxify allows developers to select and apply the necessary features instantly to their projects. By utilizing Firebase Functions with APIs such as Stripe or Discord, it enables a focus on feature development by omitting frontend development. Furthermore, it supports modern app development comprehensively, from data analysis with BigQuery to developing Web3 apps compatible with blockchain wallets.

■ Advantages for Developers

The Taxify CLI fully supports the construction of cloud architecture, allowing developers to concentrate on application development. Utilizing generative AI (LLM), it offers powerful features such as multi-language support for generating translation files, Prisma schema support, and code file generation tailored to Firebase Functions routing, including document generation.

■ Auto-Scaling and Cost Management

Auto-scaling capabilities automatically handle unpredictable load fluctuations, freeing you from the complexities of infrastructure design, development costs, and resource provisioning. With a pay-as-you-go model, you're only charged for the resources used, making it easier to start projects.

■ CI/CD and Security

Native support for GitHub Actions simplifies the setup of CI/CD environments. Additionally, features for enhancing security, such as load balancer configuration and the use of Cloud Armor, are also included.
